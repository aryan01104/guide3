    1.  First, analyze the `flawed_extraction` data below. Does the `concept` accurately and precisely capture the idea, action, or entity being evaluated in the `TARGET SENTENCE`?
    2.  If it is not accurate, re-read the `TARGET SENTENCE` and identify the correct concept.
    3.  If the corrected concept contains a pronoun (it, he, she, they, that, etc.), examine the surrounding `CONTEXT` sentences to determine what the pronoun refers to. Add this information to a `references` field.
    4.  If you determine that no clear value judgment is being made in the sentence, return an empty JSON object: {}.
    5.  Return ONLY a single, valid JSON object containing the corrected data. The `concept` must be a direct quote.
